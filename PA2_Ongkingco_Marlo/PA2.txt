a. What are your observations?

b. Do you find the observed behavior reasonable? Why or why not?

c. What kind of considerations did you make for your implementation of the Critical Section? Provide reasoning / justification.

[EXTRA] What do you think would happen if instead of having the Threads loop over the int
array to compute a local arraySum, and finally update the totalSum, we were instead just directly
adding to totalSum each time we were accessing an array element within each Thread (i.e. within
the Threadâ€™s for loop)? Why?
